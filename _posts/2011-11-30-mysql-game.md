This is the most awesome, and yet most strange thing I think I have ever found. I tried to search on Google for MySQL on AppSpot, and the result I got was called “mysqlgame.” Of course out of curiosity I had to try it. Turns out it’s a <abbr title="Massively Multiplayer Online">MMO</abbr> game where there is no <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>, you have direct, live views of all of the queries on the database.

This is the text from the main page:
<blockquote>Are you tired of browser-based games that are thinly veiled interfaces for databases? Finally, there's a game that just is a database!
THRILL as you insert your very own row in the "rows" table!
With careful selection of SQL queries, you will soon have three or even four-digit numbers in some of the fields in your row! Other queries may allow you to use those numbers to subtract from rows entered by other players -- all while pushing the numbers in your own row even higher!
As you master the game, you may find that you have inserted not just one row into the game, but several! Log in on the right to get started.</blockquote>
