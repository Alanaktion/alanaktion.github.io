Throughout my time developing websites, I've done quite a bit of design work as well. Here are a few examples of things I've designed.

## Zippa

![Vault](//blog.phpizza.com/assets/portfolio/firefox/zippa.png)
</div>

After a few pivots, my co-founder Mike and I have moved from StructHub to Zippa, a knowledge base platform. This is our first design using the new brand. Mike did most of the design of the main pages, while I handled the implementation and design of the individual UI components and back-end.

## Vault

</div>

Vault is a social network concept I'm working on in my spare time. It's currently in very early development stages, but the source code and mockups are available on the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/svlt). This version was built on the Bootstrap 4 alphas, using custom vector graphics and a complex responsive design, but will likely be rewritten on a different platform at some point.

## Cubik Network

</div>

Cubik Network is a social network I designed and developed in cooperation with a team in the UK. It's built on a modified Bootstrap 2, and is mostly responsive. This site was really my first major project using responsive design, as well as my first time trying out Bootstrap, but I've loved how the overall look of the site turned out.

## Phproject Documentation
<div class="img-responsive-container img-ratio-16-10" markdown="1">
![Phproject Documentation](//blog.phpizza.com/assets/portfolio/firefox/phproject-docs.png)
</div>

This is the documentation site built for my open-source project management system Phproject. The landing page shows some of the basic features of the application, and primarily acts as an introduction and a way to get to more specific sections of the documentation, or to try out the [demo](http://demo.phproject.org/), download the application, or contribute on GitHub. It's built on Bootstrap 3 and Jekyll, and uses hand-coded vector graphics where possible to look consistent on high-DPI displays.

## StructHub
<div class="img-responsive-container img-ratio-16-10" markdown="1">
![StructHub](//blog.phpizza.com/assets/portfolio/firefox/structhub.png)
</div>

This is an early landing page for StructHub, a startup I co-founded with Michael Robinson. We developed a brand, landing page, and several Facebook ads in the early stages following this minimalistic style.
