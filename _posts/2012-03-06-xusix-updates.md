Our social network <a href="http://www.xusix.com">Xusix</a> has been under development for quite a while now, and we'd like to introduce some of the neat things we've added in recent times.
<ul>
	<li>Live comments</li>
<ul>
	<li>When you comment on a post, it instantaneously send the comment out, and anyone viewing the post is shown the new comment.  The text box immediately lets you write another comment, allowing a live, ongoing conversation.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Mobile Access</li>
<ul>
	<li>The Xusix layout has recently been redesigned from the ground up, and although it looks exactly the same on a desktop browser, it now optimizes automatically for netbooks, tablets, and mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Direct Notifications</li>
<ul>
	<li>Users can now customize their notification preferences, with support for informing them of activity on their page through both email and text message, direct to all major U.S. carriers.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Photo support</li>
<ul>
	<li>Xusix now allows uploading an unlimited number of photos, and each supports a caption and its own live comment stream.  The entire photo gallery system is optimized to fit all screen sizes, from a Mac Cinema Display to an iPod touch.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Privacy Configuration</li>
<ul>
	<li>Control what groups can see basic information about you, and mark posts as private to only display them to people you follow.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
All of these, and many other features are now available for free on <a href="http://www.xusix.com">Xusix</a>.  <a href="http://www.xusix.com/join">Sign up today</a>!
