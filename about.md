### Alan Hardman

I'm a web developer & designer with several years of freelance and professional experience. I'm interested in all kinds of technology, but my major focus is on developing web & mobile applications. I also have skills in other related fields like database design, corporate writing, and graphic arts.

I'm @alanaktion on just about everything, including [GitHub](https://github.com/Alanaktion), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alanaktion), [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/alanaktion), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/alanaktion), and [Steam](https://www.steamcommunity.com/id/alanaktion). I'm also on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/873843/alanaktion) and several other developer communities under my real name.
