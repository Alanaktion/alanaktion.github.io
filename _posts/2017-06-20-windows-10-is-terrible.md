title: Windows 10 is Terrible

excerpt: Windows 10 is still terrible. Especially on Surface hardware.

I frequently whine about not liking Windows 10, but often don't explain why. Usually that's because I'm ranting on Twitter and don't feel like breaking my rant into several tweets.

I think I need to just write a solid list of reasons Windows 10 sucks. Here we go...

- Pre-installs terrible mobile games even on paid installs and domain-joined computers
- Shows advertisements on lock screen and Start menu by default even though I paid $200 for a license and $3000 for a Surface Book. Apple doesn't do this and they've given OS updates for free for ages.
- The Start menu doesn't always open. This is much better now than when Windows 10 first launched, but it's still far more common than it should be.
- Cortana is no longer optional, I can't just have a classic Start menu search without all the tracking
- Explorer crashes nearly every time I do a file operation on more than 100,000 files.
- Connecting to a VPN takes far more steps than it should
- PC Settings is still missing most of the functionality from Control Panel
- Typing to search directly from Start doesn't work if you've interacted with the menu at all, even just scrolling. As a keyboard-heavy user, this behavior is quite frustrating.

Microsoft's own Surface products have even more issues than my other PCs. I've heavily used both the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book with Performance Base and experienced similar issues on both.

- The trackpad frequently stops accepting scroll gestures and tap-to-click
- The Surface Pen sometimes disconnects completely
- The Surface Pen buttons frequently stop working, leaving only the pen tip usable.
- Touch input stops working intermittently
- Waking from sleep on the Surface Book by pressing a keyboard key only works about 10% of the time. The rest of the time, the keyboard base wakes, but the tablet stays off.
- The wireless network adapter sometimes disappears until a reboot
- The Type Cover on the Surface Pro 4 often stops working and needs to be physically reconnected. That's quite ridiculous for a $130 keyboard.

This is just the stuff I can think of off the top of my head. I'll probably add more as I think of it. Windows 10 has come a long way from the absolute pile of garbage it was the first year or so after RTM, but it still has a long way to go.
