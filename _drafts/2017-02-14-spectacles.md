I *despise* social media. Facebook is nothing but sponsored ads and obscure reminders, Snapchat is just weird filters over poorly lit selfies, and Twitter is full of (brief :P) political rants.

For some reason, everyone seems to love it all. Everyone has their preferred social network. I'm often posting random tech thoughts on Twitter or reposint Steven Universe fan art on Tumblr. I was interested in Facebook in the earlier days, back when you never saw a sponsored post, and I briefly tried Instagram when everyone was obsessed with taking pictures of their food, but I've really never understood the appeal of Snapchat. It's incredibly popular, but every time I try to get into it I just get annoyed with the bad UI and complete lack of interesting content. So when Snap, Inc. announced their new name and their first product, you'd think I had no interest.

Snap, Inc.'s Spectacles are amazing. They're some of the best-designed reasonably-affordable new tech I've seen in a long time. The build quality of every part is fantastic, from the custom magnetic USB cable to the charging case. Every little bit of the hardware is designed to serve a purpose without getting in the way of the user.
