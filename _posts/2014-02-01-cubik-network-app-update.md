I've released a new version of the Cubik Network Android application, with several minor fixes and a couple new features.

* Fixed screen rotation resetting the activity, causing the webpage to reload
* Enable TLS/SSL by default throughout the application
* Support for Android 2.2 (Froyo) and higher, tested on my Nexus 5 (which is srsly the best phone evar)
