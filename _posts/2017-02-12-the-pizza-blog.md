Between regularly ordering take out pizza, baking frozen pizzas several nights a week, and often going to sit-down pizza restaurants, I eat quite a lot of pizza.

For no real reason other than that I like websites, pizza, and photography, I've started a blog about pizza! I give brief reviews and usually include a photo of most of the pizzas I eat. Check it out at [alan.pizza](https://alan.pizza/). Yes I love that domain.
