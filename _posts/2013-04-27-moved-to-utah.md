This is almost a year late, but I just haven't really cared to update my blog.  Not really sure why I'm doing it now, not like anyone even reads it.... but anyway, I'm living in Utah now!  I grew up in Utah, then lived in Montana through high school (awesome place, totally recommend living there), and now I'm back in Utah.

I recently (1½ months ago) got a job at Thrive Life as a web developer, and I really like it there.
