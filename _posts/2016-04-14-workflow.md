Over the last few years, I've worked on an open source project management system called [Phproject](http://www.phproject.org). It's [on GitHub](https://github.com/Alanaktion/phproject) under a GPL license, and you should use it.

Apparently I did a good enough job of it that someone tried to sell it. A Slovakian team going by the name KreaHive rebranded it as "Workflow", and [posted it to CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/item/workflow-project-management-system/14551384). Apparently it was removed from the site quite quickly as I never saw it active, but I found it quite funny. After a bit more research, they have a public revision history that perfectly matches my latest updates [on RevCTRL](https://www.revctrl.com/kreahive/Workflow), and even made it to a business software review site, [Capterra](http://www.capterra.com/project-management-software/spotlight/150391/Workflow/KreaHive).

Then it got even better. I found a supposedly "nulled" version of Workflow [on a site called Guest Post](https://www.guestpost.xyz/2016/03/20/download-workflow-project-management-system-project-management-tools-nulled-free/). Sadly the download links just redirect you back to the Code Canyon site, I would've loved to see what code changes were made in a nulled version of a stolen version of my open source project. At least they linked to a neat [marketing graphic](https://blog.phpizza.com/assets/workflow/guestpost.jpg) for it.
