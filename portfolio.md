Throughout my time developing websites, I've done quite a bit of design work as well. Here are a few examples of things I've designed.

## Phproject Documentation
![Phproject Documentation](//blog.phpizza.com/assets/portfolio/firefox/phproject-docs.png)

This is the documentation site built for my open-source project management system Phproject. The landing page shows some of the basic features of the application, and primarily acts as an introduction and a way to get to more specific sections of the documentation, or to try out the [demo](http://demo.phproject.org/), download the application, or contribute on GitHub. It's built on Bootstrap 3 and Jekyll, and uses hand-coded vector graphics where possible to look consistent on high-DPI displays.

## Cubik Network

Cubik Network is a social network I designed and developed in cooperation with a team in the UK. It's built on a modified Bootstrap 2, and is mostly responsive. This site was really my first major project using responsive design, as well as my first time trying out Bootstrap, but I've loved how the overall look of the site turned out.

## Vault

Vault is a new social network I'm working on in partnership with my good friend Michal Robinson. It's currently available as a invite-only beta, but the source code and mockups are available on our [GitHub organization page](https://github.com/svlt). It's being built on the Bootstrap 4 alphas, using custom vector graphics and a complex responsive design.
