These are incredibly delicious!  Please note that this is a pretty complicated recipe compared to most that I post here.  I had a hard time getting it right the first time.

Ingredients:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px">½ cup warm water
</span></li>
	<li>1½ tsp yeast</li>
	<li>2 tbsp dry milk</li>
	<li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
	<li>2 tbsp oil</li>
	<li>2 tbsp egg</li>
	<li>1 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1½ cup flour</li>
</ul>
Instructions
<h5>Day 1</h5>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px">Measure water and pour into mixer bowl</span></li>
	<li>Sprinkle yeast over warm water, stir to dissolve</li>
	<li>Add the dry milk, sugar, oil, egg, salt, and ¾ cup flour.  Mix well after every addition.</li>
	<li>On low speed, gradually add ¾ cup flour, ¼ cup at a time.  Mix well after every addition.</li>
	<li>If dough is still sticky, knead more flour into the dough by hand.</li>
	<li>When dough is no longer sticky and there is no flour visible on the outside, put the dough hook on the mixer and knead dough for 3-4 minutes.</li>
	<li>If time allows, let dough rest for 10 minutes</li>
	<li>Cut dough into 6 pieces and roll each piece into approximately 15-18" strips, then shape into pretzels.</li>
	<li>Place on baking pans and refrigerate overnight.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Day 2</h5>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px">Preheat oven to 400°F</span></li>
	<li>Fill sauce pan with water, approximately half full.  Add 1½ tsp baking soda.</li>
	<li>Bring water to a boil.  Using a slotted spoon, boil each pretzel for 45 seconds to 1 minute.  Lift pretzel out of the water and allow water to drain off.</li>
	<li>Brush the tops of pretzels with an egg wash and sprinkle with course salt if desired.</li>
	<li>Bake for 15-20 minutes</li>
</ol>
