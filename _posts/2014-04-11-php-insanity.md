> It was a cold day, Gustav arrived for his first day at work
clutching his laptop and some books on the Zend framework.
His past nights had been disturbed by the 'Tetris effect',
lines of pure code produced by his unconscious mind in his
sleep, dropping down, one atop the other, leaving him in
somewhat of a half awake, half asleep state throughout the
nights. His world view was formed through code, indeed
giving him great insight, yet leaving him somewhat distant
from those around him.

> He was starting to question his sanity. A formidable PHP Zend
coder, instead of taking rest in its conventional sense, his
mind would be occupied with thoughts on RESTful services,
instead of using soap in the bath, he would be comparing SOAP
with RESTful services. He took a single bite on a pear, the
only food he had eaten in two weeks, and instantly started
thinkng of PEAR and PECL extensions. Instead of eating, he
would usually be coding, his natural hunger instinct shut
off from the deep levels of focus that he sustained during
coding sessions. Am I human? he asked himself one day, clearly
feeling that his very existence had merged with the technology
with which he was engaged on a day to day basis.

> His family life remained intact, a bright wife who understood
his predicament serving as a buffer between his internal world
and the world around him. Even when talking with her, his mind
would drift onto coding, sometimes so much so, that he lost
awareness of her very presence.

> As he calmly, as if programmed, walked through the porte-cochÃ¨re
leading to the entrance of the office, he felt totally in control,
as if on a mission to take charge of his young colleagues and guide
them in the right direction on the greenfield LAMP platform-build
that he was to be in charge of. He knew that this would be no easy
feat, but felt reassured that he would be able to get on with producing
a large amount of the purest code himself, whilst overseeing the 4
strong team of fastidious developers that already worked at the company,
rather than being a mere hands off development manager.

> As he arrived at his desk, he was astounded by the office environment,
a wondrous place, void of unnecessary ornementation, fine desks
sculpted from burr walnut. A minimalistic, clutter free environment
seemed exactly what young Gustav needed to allow his coding to
flourish. The air was as clean, a distant memory pervaded his mind,
reminding him of the clean childhod air of the Matterhorn foothills
in which he was raised. He mused on the brilliance of the architecture
holding him, a hybrid blend of Le Corbusier and Ahrends Burton Koralek
he decided..... indeed he had many other interests in addition to his
coding.......
