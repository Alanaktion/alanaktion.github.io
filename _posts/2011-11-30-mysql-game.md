This is the most awesome, and yet strangest thing I think I have ever found. I tried to search on Google for MySQL on AppSpot, and the result I got was called "mysqlgame." Of course out of curiosity I had to try it. Turns out it's an <abbr title="Massively Multiplayer Online">MMO</abbr> game where there is no <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>, you have direct, live views of all of the queries on the database.

> Are you tired of browser-based games that are thinly veiled interfaces for databases? Finally, there's a game that just is a database!
> THRILL as you insert your very own row in the "rows" table!
> With careful selection of SQL queries, you will soon have three or even four-digit numbers in some of the fields in your row! Other queries may allow you to use those numbers to subtract from rows entered by other players -- all while pushing the numbers in your own row even higher!
> As you master the game, you may find that you have inserted not just one row into the game, but several! Log in on the right to get started.
