These aren't as good as the <a title="2-Day Soft Pretzels" href="/2013/02/02/2-day-soft-pretzels/">other soft pretzels I posted</a>, but they're a lot quicker and easier to make.

Ingredients:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px">1¼ tsp yeast</span></li>
	<li>½ cup + 2 tbsp + 2 tsp water</li>
	<li>½ tbsp sugar</li>
	<li>¼ tsp salt</li>
	<li>1¾-2 cups flour</li>
	<li>2 tbsp egg (~1 egg)</li>
	<li>½ tbsp water</li>
	<li>1 tbsp course salt</li>
</ul>
Directions
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 14px">Preheat oven to 425°F</span></li>
	<li>Grease one large jelly roll pan</li>
	<li>In mixer bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water 'til dissolved</li>
	<li>Mix in sugar, salt, and ½ cup flour.  Continue to add flour in ¼ cup bits until batter turns to dough.  Blend each ¼ cup thoroughly before adding the next.
You will know if you have enough flour if:
1) Mix "cleans" the inside of the bowl
2) Dough doesn't stick to fingers</li>
	<li>When dough is no longer sticky, it can be kneaded in mixer bowl with the dough hook for 3-4 minutes</li>
	<li>Divide dough into 6 equal parts, roll each piece to about 15" long and from into a pretzel shape</li>
	<li>Place pretzels 3" apart on baking sheet</li>
	<li>Brush pretzels with an egg wash and sprinkle with course salt if desired</li>
	<li>Bake 12-15 minutes</li>
</ol>
