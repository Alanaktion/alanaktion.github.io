About a month ago, I was working on a simple code project for school in some free time.  It's a web site that takes simple phrases and makes a song out of them, based on the <em>99 bottles of beer</em> song.  I rediscovered the fun little script today, and you can see my song <a href="http://mirror.phpizza.com/broncgeeks/s12/p5/HardmanA/projects/beer/beer.php?count=6&amp;cont=hard+drive&amp;fluid=code&amp;prep=in&amp;location=server&amp;act=Take+one+out+because+it+died&amp;end=Get+online+and+buy+some+more">here</a>.  When you write a song with it, the URL that shows the song will always show your song, so you can send that link around to share it with anyone!
