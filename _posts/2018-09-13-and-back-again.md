excerpt: StructHub is back. And this time it's serious.

After a bit of time trying some other ventures, including a few things we definitely intend to get back to at some point because they're awesome, we're back on StructHub!

Mike and I are hard at work again building a proper company out of our crazy ideas, and it's going fairly well this time around. I'm currently building most of our software stack on Laravel, including an instruction editor, a media file manager, and a consumer app. We're also most likely going to use Flutter to build our iOS and Android apps when the time comes, which is looking increasingly usable lately.
