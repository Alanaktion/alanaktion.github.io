excerpt: We've reached a point in web technology where we're just making everything worse for no real reason.

It's 2018. The web has more potential to be incredible now than it ever has before, with all major browsers supporting a huge number of powerful modern technologies, including HTTP/2, SVG, and CSS Flexible Boxes and Grids. With all of this consistency in support and optimization in engines and network stack, our websites should be faster and more robust than ever.

But they're not.

We've reached a point in the industry where most new web developers learn just enough code to start building, but are never exposed to the greater needs surrounding development. Things like accessibility, compatibility, and performance are afterthoughts, rather than core concepts within a website's architecture. Even simple things like UI state changes due to user input are being replaced with buggy JavaScript that only occasionally approximates what the browser could do natively if only we'd let it.
