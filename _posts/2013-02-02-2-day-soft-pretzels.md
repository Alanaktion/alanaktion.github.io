These are incredibly delicious! Please note that this is a pretty complicated recipe compared to most that I post here. I had a hard time getting it right the first time.

Ingredients:

* ½ cup warm water
* 1½ tsp yeast
* 2 tbsp dry milk
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp egg
* 1 tsp salt
* 1½ cup flour

Instructions

### Day 1

1. Measure water and pour into mixer bowl
1. Sprinkle yeast over warm water, stir to dissolve
1. Add the dry milk, sugar, oil, egg, salt, and ¾ cup flour. Mix well after every addition.
1. On low speed, gradually add ¾ cup flour, ¼ cup at a time. Mix well after every addition.
1. If dough is still sticky, knead more flour into the dough by hand.
1. When dough is no longer sticky and there is no flour visible on the outside, put the dough hook on the mixer and knead dough for 3-4 minutes.
1. If time allows, let dough rest for 10 minutes
1. Cut dough into 6 pieces and roll each piece into approximately 15-18" strips, then shape into pretzels.
1. Place on baking pans and refrigerate overnight.

### Day 2

1. Preheat oven to 400°F
1. Fill sauce pan with water, approximately half full. Add 1½ tsp baking soda.
1. Bring water to a boil. Using a slotted spoon, boil each pretzel for 45 seconds to 1 minute. Lift pretzel out of the water and allow water to drain off.
1. Brush the tops of pretzels with an egg wash and sprinkle with course salt if desired.
1. Bake for 15-20 minutes
