Throughout my time developing websites and apps, I've done quite a bit of design work as well. Here are a few examples of things I've designed.

## Zippa

</div>

After a few pivots, my co-founder Mike and I have moved from StructHub to Zippa, a knowledge base platform. This is our first design using the new brand. Mike did most of the design of the main pages, while I handled the implementation and design of the individual UI components and back-end.

## Zippa Brand Guide

</div>

The Zippa site has a strong, opinionated UI, with bold colors and fonts. To keep that consistent and clean, I designed a branding page that covers color use, logo options, typography, and basic UI patterns.

## Thrive Life Redesign Concept

</div>

The Thrive Life shopping experience isn't terrible, but definitely shows its age. As a way of thinking through new UI options, I designed the basics of the shopping experience in an Apple-like style. I think it really fits well with the clean aesthetic the company goes for in other marketing materials.

## Thrive Life Web Style Guide

</div>

While working at Thrive Life, I became frustrated with the lack of consistency in design patterns, color use, and font choices. To solve this, I created a basic style guide that standardized the basic front-end design process, with colors, fonts, components, and prose guidelines.

## Vault

</div>

Vault is a social network concept I'm working on in my spare time. It's currently in very early development stages, but the source code and mockups are available on the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/svlt). This version was built on the Bootstrap 4 alphas, using custom vector graphics and a complex responsive design, but will likely be rewritten on a different platform at some point.

## Cubik Network

</div>

Cubik Network is a social network I designed and developed in cooperation with a team in the UK. It's built on a modified Bootstrap 2, and is mostly responsive. This site was really my first major project using responsive design, as well as my first time trying out Bootstrap, but I've loved how the overall look of the site turned out.

## Phproject Documentation
<div class="img-responsive-container img-ratio-16-10" markdown="1">

</div>

This is the documentation site built for my open-source project management system Phproject. The landing page shows some of the basic features of the application, and primarily acts as an introduction and a way to get to more specific sections of the documentation, or to try out the [demo](http://demo.phproject.org/), download the application, or contribute on GitHub. It's built on Bootstrap 3 and Jekyll, and uses hand-coded vector graphics where possible to look consistent on high-DPI displays.

## StructHub
<div class="img-responsive-container img-ratio-16-10" markdown="1">
<img src="//blog.phpizza.com/assets/portfolio/firefox/structhub.png" loading="lazy" alt="StructHub">
</div>

This is an early landing page for StructHub, a startup I co-founded with Michael Robinson. We developed a brand, landing page, and several Facebook ads in the early stages following this minimalistic style.
