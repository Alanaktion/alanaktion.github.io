### Alan Hardman

I'm a web developer & designer with several years of freelance and professional experience. I'm interested in all kinds of technology, but my major focus is on developing web & mobile applications. I also have skills in other related fields like database design, corporate writing, and UI design. I'm a strong believer in minimalism, as so many users have trouble understanding and using complex applications. Also it just looks better.

I'm @alanaktion on just about everything, including [GitHub](https://github.com/Alanaktion), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alanaktion), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alanaktion/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/alanaktion), and [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/alanaktion). I'm also on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/873843/alanaktion) and several other developer communities under my real name.

### Blog

This blog is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted by [GitHub](https://pages.github.com), and using a modified version of the beautiful [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). I don't update here very often, but the blog has become a place for me to keep things I use frequently including a regex lookaround cheatsheet, my favorite Sublime Text plugins, and other developer and non-developer things. I have some recipes from when I was in high school, and a few posts from my old, old, old Blogger blog.
