These aren't as good as the [other soft pretzels I posted](/2013/02/02/2-day-soft-pretzels/), but they're a lot quicker and easier to make.

Ingredients:

* 1¼ tsp yeast
* ½ cup + 2 tbsp + 2 tsp water
* ½ tbsp sugar
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1¾-2 cups flour
* 2 tbsp egg (~1 egg)
* ½ tbsp water
* 1 tbsp course salt

Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F
1. Grease one large jelly roll pan
1. In mixer bowl, sprinkle yeast over warm water 'til dissolved
1. Mix in sugar, salt, and ½ cup flour.  Continue to add flour in ¼ cup bits until batter turns to dough.  Blend each ¼ cup thoroughly before adding the next.
 You will know if you have enough flour if
 1) Mix "cleans" the inside of the bowl
 2) Dough doesn't stick to fingers
1. When dough is no longer sticky, it can be kneaded in mixer bowl with the dough hook for 3-4 minutes
1. Divide dough into 6 equal parts, roll each piece to about 15" long and from into a pretzel shape
1. Place pretzels 3" apart on baking sheet
1. Brush pretzels with an egg wash and sprinkle with course salt if desired
1. Bake 12-15 minutes
